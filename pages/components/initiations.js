              <center>What is the Vitamin Air Initiative?</center>
            </h2>
              <p>The Vitamin Air Initiative is a local grassroots educational project. Our goal is not for personal profit, rather we aim to collaborate with local schools to ensure all neighboring children have an opportunity to attain a basic elementary education.</p>
              <p>
                The Vitamin Air Initiative is focused on community development, with an aim to educate both children and adults, to provide health care and nutrition services in partnership with volunteer doctors, and to create employment opportunities for villagers who want to protect their forest surroundings.</p>
              <p>Today we are able to provide an informal open-air educational program with foundational studies in art, science, technology, and sports.
              </p>
              <p>As we grow and mature, our hope is to replicate our model and expand our services to include more small and isolated communities throughout Cambodia.</p> 
              <p>In all we do, we foster love and respect for nature and each other, raising within each of us an awareness of the importance of preserving and protecting our forest and the world that surrounds us.</p>
              <p>We want to influence the minds of the next generation while creating alternative income opportunities in order to curb illegal wood harvesting and charcoal production. We want to end the cruelty to animals and the destructive consequences of trapping and wildlife poaching.</p>

            <h1 style={{marginTop: "3%" } }>A life changing learning experience for everyone</h1>
            <p>To set the Vitamin Air Initiative into motion, we must hire two full-time Teachers and two full-time Forest Rangers.</p>
            <p>Salaries are budgeted at a cost of 200 USD per month for each of the four positions,  and with an additional 200 USD per month for kitchen, operational and development expense, we anticipate a total monthly budget of 1000 USD per month.</p>
            <p>Our two Forest Rangers will also serve as Teachers in the field, influencing children and elders as they monitor local forest activity and collaborate with area authorities and conservation groups.</p>
            <p>Rangers will be on steady watch as they patrol the surrounding forest daily, ready to take action and intervene in illegal forest activities. They will disable traps, help restore woodlands, and clear grasslands while taking measures to prevent forest fires. </p>
            <p>True to the crowdfunding spirit, we believe that many of us working together while contributing small amounts over an extended period of time will have a greater, more sustainable impact.</p>
            <p>We are not seeking large donations or one-time grants from wealthy contributors, rather we want to bring together a community of steady investors who will contribute small amounts regularly, and who will stand behind our work for the years ahead. 
</p>        <p>If all of us today will commit to contributing only 10,000 KHR (2.50 USD) each month for 12 months, we are convinced that we will have a positive impact upon our community and upon the lives of our children for generations to come. 
</p>        <p>It is our dream and most sincere hope that you will be able to help us provide these much needed services to our community and the world.</p>
            <p>Please join with us today because we need you to make this happen!</p>

            <p>On behalf of our team, Sela Thul does hereby proudly and honorably represent and hold the primary leadership role for promoting and managing the "VitaminAir Initiative" program.</p>
            <p>As we all live and work together at the VitaminAir community, each day we are witnessing the challenges and issues the families, children, and adults of the Red Moon valley must face.</p>
            <p>Therefore, each of us as team members have decided to take action and create the "VitaminAir Initiative" with a vision for having a positive impact upon our community, ecological system, and the lives of local families for generations to come.</p>

            <h1  style={{marginTop: "3%" }}>How the dream began</h1>
            <p>I, Sela Thul arrived on this land to build the Vitamin Air community on February 4th, 2020. Since then, I've settled into a new way of life together with the people of the nearby local villages. Each day as I go trekking through the surrounding hills and jungle to explore the villages, I see many small children playing on the roads and in the fields.</p>
            <p>
During the dry season, often there is the sound of chainsaws and woodcutters at work, with the fire and smoke from charcoal ovens in all the surrounding hills. After a while, I began to notice the animal traps left behind by area trappers, and once my dog Ling Long was severely injured when caught in a trap.</p>
            <p>All of this caused me to think long and hard, asking myself the question, how can I help solve all of these problems in our community?</p>
            <p>Each morning I would reflect on this question, speaking with friends, neighbors, and even the children, to find the very best answers and solutions. Now after some research and study, I've decided that the way of life for many villagers must change, and the best way to initiate life changes is through children and education. Recently, I began a small educational experiment providing basic outdoor literacy classes for our local children. </p>
            <p>My dream is for each of our children to be able to read and write, to learn about nature, and to have an elementary exposure to mathematics. Today we are only able to provide instruction for 10 children, but there are still an additional 187 boys and 156 girls ages 3 through 14 who also want education.</p>
            <p>The children are primarily residents of the Red Moon valley, Kampong Seila, Preah Sihanoukville, in Cambodia. The main elementary school there has not had much success due to lack of teachers and educational materials. There is a larger elementary school located several kilometers away along National Road 4, but they struggle too, and are unable to help the children.</p>
            <p>Parents and elders of the Red Moon valley are concerned about the safety of their children while away at school, and many have defaulted to keeping their children at home. According to my research, I've concluded that only 30 percent of children are able to attend secondary school, while of those only 4 to 8 percent are able to finish high school, and only 2 percent will reach university.</p>
            <p>We can see that if something isn't done soon, this trend will lead to much higher illiteracy rates as the next generation matures, and everyone here is very concerned about the consequences</p>
